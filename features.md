The labels in this dataset

Distribution of Labels
The labels in this dataset are simple. There are three possible values:

functional - the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
functional needs repair - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
non functional - the waterpoint is not operational
