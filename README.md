## Business Problem


Tanzania ministry of agriculture wishes to upgrade the available waterpoints in Tanzania. They wish to know in advance which waterpoints are still functional, those that are functional but are in poor conditions and hence may need repairs and also to know those that are not functional at all. The ministry wishes for me to come up with a cost effective way which will enable them to identify and allocate sufficient resources to the needed areas.Through this project, the ministry is able to sufficiently plan and allocate resources to areas which would be in need of access to water. We all know how important water is to the daily activity of human beings, therefore the solutions in this project will go a long way in helping governments and organizations to plan how to implement water policies in Tanzania.
